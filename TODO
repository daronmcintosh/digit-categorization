  ✔ Implement k-folds @done(19-04-29 23:46)
  ☐ Fix the neural network classifier because it is only getting a 10% accuracy
  ☐ Create a confusion matrix to store the sum of all the confusion matrices
  ☐ For each k-fold
    ☐ Generate a confusion matrix and add it to the 'total' confusion matrix
    ☐ Calculate precision, recall, f1-score, mcc score per digit
  ☐ Calculate mcc score for entire confusion matrix
  ☐ Save each confusion matrix to one file or 10 separate files
