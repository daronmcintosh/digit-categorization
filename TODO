Todo:
  ✔ Implement k-folds @done(19-04-29 23:46)
  ✔ Fix the neural network classifier because it is only getting a 10% accuracy @done(19-05-01 13:25)
  ✔ Create a confusion matrix to store the sum of all the confusion matrices @done(19-04-30 17:17)
  ✔ For each k-fold @done(19-04-30 17:17)
    ✘ Generate a confusion matrix and add it to the 'total' confusion matrix @cancelled(19-04-30 17:17)
    ✔ Calculate precision, recall, f1-score, mcc score per digit @done(19-04-30 17:17)
  ✔ Calculate mcc score for entire confusion matrix @done(19-04-30 17:17)
  ✘ Save each confusion matrix to one file or 10 separate files @cancelled(19-04-30 17:17)
  ☐ Create a production file to select saved model and used that to make predictions
